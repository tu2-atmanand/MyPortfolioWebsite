### How to update Website

After all the edits, once you are ready for deployment :

1. Run ```npm run deploy```
2. Then run ```git add .```.
3. And ```git commit -m "Updated Website for Hosting, V#"
4. Run ```git push```

>**NOTE** : Mostly you dont even need to run the rest of steps the first command iteself push the code also, How cool it is. Also wait atleast for 5 min to see the changes **LIVE**.

> Possibly when you run ```rpm run deploy``` what was happening is, it swithces to gh-pages commit all the changes with its predefined commit message, and than when i pushes the all the changes, that branch gets updated and hosting happens. Thats why you have to run this command only when you feel that this is updated version you have to host.
